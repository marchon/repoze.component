  zope.component
     The system from which the ideas in repoze.component are derived.
  repoze.configuration
    A system that allows for the loading of configuration directives
    from `YAML <http://yaml.org>`_ files.  ``utility`` and ``adapter``
    directives are included with :mod:`repoze.component` that can be
    spelled in a YAML configuration file when :mod:`repoze.component`
    is used with the ``repoze.configuration`` package.  See
    :ref:`loading_from_a_config_file` for more information.
